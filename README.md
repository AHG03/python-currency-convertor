## üõ†Ô∏è Code Overview

The script is structured into four main functions:

| Function | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get_amount()` | Prompts the user for the amount to convert and handles **ValueError** exceptions for invalid (non-numeric or non-positive) input. |
| `get_currency(label)` | Prompts the user for a currency code (Source or Target) and validates the input against the supported list (`usd`, `eur`, `cad`). |
| `convert(amount, source_currency, target_currency)` | Contains the fixed `exchange_rates` and performs the conversion calculation. |
| `main()` | The main execution function that calls the input functions and prints the final result. |

## üîß Exchange Rates

The current exchange rates are hardcoded within the `convert` function:

| From | To EUR | To CAD |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **USD** | 0.85 | 1.25 |
| **EUR** | 1.18 (to USD) | 1.47 |
| **CAD** | 0.80 (to USD) | 0.68 (to EUR) |

*Note: These rates are fixed and do not update in real-time.*
